1. Explain the purpose of EC2PrimeDeployRole and why it needs S3 permissions.
Answer: 
The purpose of the EC2PrimeDeployRole is to allow the instance to access AWS services securely. 
The files for the instance are stored in the s3 bucket so it needs the permissions to access them so that it can exicute the deployment process properly. 

2. How does appspec.yml ensure the application runs after deployment?
Answer:
It ensures that the application will run after deployment by defining some scripts.
This includes:
1. AfterInstall: This runs the necessary setup scripts
2. ApplicationStart: This starts or restarts the application service.

3. If the EC2 instance were in a private subnet, what changes would be needed for CodeDeploy to work?
Answer:
One of the changes would need to be configuring a VPC endpoint for CodeDeploy and the S3 which would allow the instance to communicate with CodeDeploy and S3
without internet access.
Another change would be to add a NAT Gateway which would allow outbound internet access for the EC2 instance to be able to reach the AWS services.
